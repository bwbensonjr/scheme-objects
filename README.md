# Scheme Objects

Work on object systems for the Scheme programming language

## Goal 1

The first goal is to get the example Scheme object system in
[`examples/tiny-clos/`](examples/tiny-clos/) running under the most
recent version of Chez Scheme, 10.3.0.

- Chez Scheme can be run using the command `chez`. 
- Chez Scheme documentation can be found in
  [`docs/chez-scheme-docs/`](docs/scheme-scheme-docs).
